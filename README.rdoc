<B>CodeClan course: Project 1 - Gig Ticket Booker</B>

<B>Objective:</B>
To produce an Edinburgh Festival ticket booking app.

<B>Must-have features:</B>

Admins need to be able to add venues, and schedule gigs at those venues - more than one gig a night. 
Gigs need to be classified with keywords to allow registered users to search for gigs.
Users must be able to book seats â€“ assuming the gig has space, and the user has no other gigs booked at that time.

<B>Approach:</B>

A web app created with Ruby on Rails and using models to represent the main components of a ticket booking system and the relationships involved.

<B>Building the app:</B>

Set up Rails with Devise for the User model.

Create models for Artist,  Venue, Gig and Booking.

Set up associations between the models (and check them in console).

Build RESTful routes for the models - and the required controllers.

Add search box on home page.

Check for schedule clashes when users are booking multiple gigs (and seat availability).

Set up Cancan so only admin can add and edit data on the site.
