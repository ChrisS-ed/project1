CodeClan course: Project 1 - Gig Ticket Booker

Objective:
To produce an Edinburgh Festival ticket booking app

Must-have features:
Admins need to be able to add venues, and schedule gigs at those venues - more than one gig a night. 
Gigs need to be classified with keywords to allow registered users to search for gigs.
Users must be able to book seats â€“ assuming the gig has space, and the user has no other gigs booked at that time.
